Exercise

1. Create a project with a main class and function.
1. Create an annotation named MyAnnotation.
2. Create a class MyClass with 4 methods that return void and do nothing:
  - 1 annotated without arguments,
  - 1 not annotated without arguments,
  - 1 annotated with one argument that extends String,
  - 1 annotated with one argument that extends Long,
3. In the main, create an object and print all of its annotated fields and methods
4. Create an object that calls the generic method, and print the type passed to the call at runtime with reflection.
5. As you can see, there is no way to accomplish this because of the way generics are implemented in Java, where type is erased at runtime. 
   Similarly, for an instance of AnotherClass<T>, reflection cannot find out the runtime type of T. The only way to achieve this would be
   for the constructor to take the Class as an argument and keep it as a field.
